# OpenAI API Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and add your OpenAI API key to enable real API calls
# Without this key, the pipeline will use mock implementations

# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# The pipeline will automatically detect the presence of this key:
# - If present: Uses real OpenAI API for embeddings and GPT responses
# - If missing: Falls back to mock implementations
# 
# This ensures the requirement: "Once OpenAI key is added, the flow should just work"
